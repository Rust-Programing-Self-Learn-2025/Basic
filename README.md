# Basic Rust

# Introduction

### **What is Rust?**
Rust is a **systems programming language** designed for **performance, safety, and concurrency**. It was created by Mozilla and is now widely used in industries like **web development, game engines, operating systems, and blockchain**.  

### **Why Use Rust? Key Advantages**  

#### **1. Memory Safety Without Garbage Collection**  
- Rust **prevents memory leaks, buffer overflows, and null pointer exceptions** at **compile time** (unlike C/C++).  
- Uses **ownership, borrowing, and lifetimes** to manage memory without a garbage collector (like Go/Java).  

#### **2. Blazing Fast Performance**  
- **Zero-cost abstractions**: High-level code compiles to efficient machine code (similar to C/C++).  
- **No runtime overhead**: Ideal for embedded systems, game engines, and high-performance applications.  

#### **3. Fearless Concurrency**  
- Rustâ€™s compiler **detects data races before runtime**, making multithreaded code safer.  
- Enables **parallel programming** without crashes or undefined behavior.  

#### **4. Modern Tooling (Cargo & Crates.io)**  
- **Cargo**: Built-in package manager (`cargo build`, `cargo run`, `cargo test`).  
- **Crates.io**: Huge ecosystem of libraries (e.g., `serde` for JSON, `tokio` for async).  

#### **5. Cross-Platform Support**  
- Compiles to **Windows, Linux, macOS, WebAssembly (WASM), and embedded systems**.  
- Used in **WebAssembly** for browser-based high-speed apps.  

#### **6. Used by Big Tech**  
- **Microsoft**: Rewriting Windows components in Rust for security.  
- **Google**: Android now supports Rust for OS-level code.  
- **Meta (Facebook)**: Uses Rust in blockchain (Diem) and backend services.

### **Example: Memory Safety in Rust**  
```rust
fn main() {
    let mut data = vec![1, 2, 3];
    let first = &data[0]; // Immutable borrow
    data.push(4); // Error! Cannot mutate while borrowed.
    println!("{}", first);
}
```
**Compiler Error**: Prevents **use-after-free** bugs at compile time.

### **When to Use Rust?**  
âœ… **System programming** (OS, drivers).  
âœ… **High-performance web servers** (e.g., Actix, Rocket).  
âœ… **Game engines** (e.g., Bevy).  
âœ… **Blockchain/Smart Contracts** (Solana, Polkadot).  
âœ… **Embedded/IoT devices**.

### **Conclusion**  
Rust combines **C/C++-level speed** with **Python/Java-like safety**, making it perfect for **critical software where crashes are unacceptable**.  

ðŸš€ **Get Started**:  
```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh  
cargo new my_project  
```  

ðŸ¦€ **"Rust is for those who crave speed without the crashes."**

## Rust installer and version management tool 

### Windows Subsystem for Linux
```
    curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

### Is Rust up to date?

```sh
    rustup update
```

### Rust version check

```sh
    rustc --version
```

### Cargo: the Rust build tool and package manager

When you install Rustup youâ€™ll also get the latest stable version of the Rust build tool and package manager, also known as Cargo. Cargo does lots of things:

- build your project with 
```sh
    cargo build
```
- run your project with 
```sh
    cargo run
```
- test your project with 
```sh
    cargo test
```
- build documentation for your project with 
```sh
    cargo doc
```
- publish a library to crates.io with 
```sh
    cargo publish
```

To test that you have Rust and Cargo installed, you can run this in your terminal of choice:

```sh
cargo --version
```

Hereâ€™s a concise English explanation of **Cargo** (for your self-learning or README file):

---

### **What is Cargo?**  
**Cargo** is Rustâ€™s official **build system** and **package manager**. It automates compiling code, managing dependencies, running tests, and moreâ€”similar to `npm` (JavaScript) or `pip` (Python), but optimized for Rustâ€™s needs.

---

### **Key Features of Cargo**  
1. **Project Creation**  
   - `cargo new my_project` generates a new project with:  
     - `src/main.rs` (entry file).  
     - `Cargo.toml` (config file for metadata/dependencies).  

2. **Dependency Management**  
   - Add packages (*crates*) to `Cargo.toml`:  
     ```toml
     [dependencies]
     serde = "1.0"  # Example: JSON serialization crate
     ```  
   - Run `cargo build` to install dependencies.  

3. **Building & Running**  
   - `cargo build`: Compiles code (debug mode).  
   - `cargo build --release`: Optimized compilation (for production).  
   - `cargo run`: Compiles + executes the program.  

4. **Testing**  
   - `cargo test`: Runs all tests in the project.  

5. **Documentation**  
   - `cargo doc --open`: Generates and opens HTML docs for your code.  

---

### **Example Workflow**  
1. Create a project:  
   ```bash
   cargo new hello_rust
   cd hello_rust
   ```  
2. Edit `src/main.rs`:  
   ```rust
   fn main() {
       println!("Hello, Cargo!");
   }
   ```  
3. Run it:  
   ```bash
   cargo run
   ```  
   Output:  
   ```
   Hello, Cargo!
   ```  

---

### **Why Use Cargo?**  
- **Simplicity**: Handles complex tasks (dependency resolution, compilation) effortlessly.  
- **Ecosystem**: Integrates with [crates.io](https://crates.io) (Rustâ€™s package registry).  
- **Safety**: Ensures dependency compatibility and secure builds.  

Ideal for beginners and large-scale projects alike! ðŸ¦€

**Tip**: Include this in your README to explain your projectâ€™s setup. Example:  
```markdown
## Build & Run  
1. Install [Rust](https://rust-lang.org).  
2. Clone this repo: `git clone <repo_url>`.  
3. Run: `cargo run`.  
```
